    <h3 align="center">A Multimodal AI Agent</h3>
</p>

## Model Overview
AIsha is an AI Agent capable of:


* Receiving and sending Whatsapp messages(limited to test account as I am not a business) 📲
* Understanding your voice 🗣️
* Recognizing your images 🖼️
* Sending voice notes back 🎤
* Sharing updates about its "daily activities" 🚣
* Sending you images of its current activities 🖼️


## Getting started

I'm referring to the virtual environment creation, dependencies installation, `.env` file creation, etc. I know, it's very boring, but it's a necessary evil! 😅

All of this is detailed in the following doc: [GETTING STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md).

> Make sure you follow the instructions in the doc, as it's crucial for the code to work.

## How much is this going to cost me?

The awesome thing about this project is **you can run it on your own computer for free!**

The **free tiers** from Groq, ElevenLabs, Qdrant Cloud, and Together AI are more than enough to get you going.

If you want to try it out on Google Cloud Run, you can get a free account and get $300 in free credits. Even if you've already used up your free credits, Cloud Run is super cheap - so it will take just a buck or two for your experiments.
